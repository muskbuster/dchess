The first 6 bits are the index the piece is moving from, and the last 6 bits are the index the piece is moving to. Since the index representing a square is at most 54, 6 bits sufficiently represents any index (0b111111 = 63 > 54). e.g. 1243 denotes a move from index 19 to 27 (1243 = (19 << 6) | 27). Since the board is represented by a uint256, consider including ``using Chess for uint256''.Below details how the metadata and art are generated: ==========================================Description=========================================== Token descriptions describe white's move in algebraic notation and black's move in algebraic notation. If white's move results in checkmating black or a stalemate, the description will say black resigned (for simplicity, stalemates are treated as checkmates). Since the engine always plays black, and the player always plays white, white is indicated as ``Player'', and black is indicated as ``fiveoutofnine''. Additionally, for every non game-ending turn, a string graphic is generated after the moves' descriptions.

The last bit denotes whose turn it is to play (0 means black's turn; 1 means white's turn). e.g. a potential starting position:                                Black                       00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                    Black                       00 03 02 05 06 02 03 00                 ♜ ♝ ♛ ♚ ♝ ♜                       00 01 01 01 01 01 01 00                 ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟                       00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00     denotes                       00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    the board                       00 09 09 09 09 09 09 00                 ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙                       00 11 12 13 14 12 11 00                 ♖ ♘ ♕ ♔ ♘ ♖                       00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01                    White                                White All numbers in the example above are in decimal representation. ======================================Move Representation======================================= Each move is allocated 12 bits. The first 6 bits are the index the piece is moving from, and the last 6 bits are the index the piece is moving to. Since the index representing a square is at most 54, 6 bits sufficiently represents any index (0b111111 = 63 > 54). e.g. 1243 denotes a move from index 19 to 27 (1243 = (19 << 6) | 27). Since the board is represented by a uint256, consider including ``using Chess for uint256''.Below details how the metadata and art are generated: ==========================================Description=========================================== Token descriptions describe white's move in algebraic notation and black's move in algebraic notation. If white's move results in checkmating black or a stalemate, the description will say black resigned (for simplicity, stalemates are treated as checkmates). Since the engine always plays black, and the player always plays white, white is indicated as ``Player'', and black is indicated as ``fiveoutofnine''. Additionally, for every non game-ending turn, a string graphic is generated after the moves' descriptions. An example:                             Player plays e4 rook captures e5 queen.                             6 · · ♜ · ♚ ♜                             5 · ♟ · · ♖ ♟                             4 ♟ ♙ ♟ ♙ * ♙                             3 ♙ · ♙ · · ·                             2 · · · · ♖ ·                             1 · ♘ · ♔ · ·                               a b c d e f                             fiveoutofnine resigns. * indicates the square the piece moved from. ==============================================Art=============================================== The art is generated as HTML code with in-line CSS (0 JS) according to the following table:  | Property       | Name      | Value/Description                       | Determination       |  | ============== | ========= | ======================================= | =================== |  | Dimension      | 1 × 1     | 1 × 1 pillars                           | Player moved king   |  | (6 traits)     | 2 × 2     | 2 × 2 pillars                           | Player moved rook   |  |                | 3 × 3     | 3 × 3 pillars                           | Engine moved bishop |  |                | 4 × 4     | 4 × 4 pillars                           | Player moved knight |  |                | 6 × 6     | 6 × 6 pillars                           | Player moved pawn   |  |                | 12 × 12   | 12 × 12 pillars                         | Player moved queen  |  | -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |  | Height         | Plane     | 8px pillar height                       | 1 / 64 chance[^0]   |  | (5 traits)     | 1/4       | 98px pillar height                      | 10 / 64 chance[^0]  |  |                | 1/2       | 197px pillar height                     | 10 / 64 chance[^0]  |  |                | Cube      | 394px pillar height                     | 40 / 64 chance[^0]  |  |                | Infinite  | 1000px pillar height                    | 3 / 64 chance[^0]   |  | -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |  | Gap[^1]        | None      | 0px gap between the pillars             | 4 / 16 chance[^0]   |  | (4 traits)     | Narrow    | 2px gap between the pillars             | 9 / 16 chance[^0]   |  |                | Wide      | 12px gap between the pillars            | 2 / 16 chance[^0]   |  |                | Ultrawide | 24px gap between the pillars            | 1 / 16 chance[^0]   |  | -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |  | Color          | Uniform   | All faces are the same color            | 7 / 32 chance[^0]   |  | Generation[^2] | Shades    | Faces get darker anticlockwise          | 7 / 32 chance[^0]   |  | (6 traits)     | Tints     | Faces get lighter anticlockwise         | 7 / 32 chance[^0]   |  |                | Eclipse   | Left face is white; black face is black | 3 / 32 chance[^0]   |  |                | Void      | Left and right face are black           | 1 / 32 chance[^0]   |  |                | Curated   | One of 8 color themes (see below)       | 7 / 32 chance[^0]   |  | -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |  | Color          | Nord      | 0x8FBCBBEBCB8BD087705E81ACB48EAD        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  | Theme[^3]      | B/W       | 0x000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF000000        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  | (8 traits)     | Candycorn | 0x0D3B66F4D35EEE964BFAF0CAF95738        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  |                | RGB       | 0xFFFF0000FF000000FFFF0000FFFF00        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  |                | VSCode    | 0x1E1E1E569CD6D2D1A2BA7FB54DC4AC        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  |                | Neon      | 0x00FFFFFFFF000000FF00FF00FF00FF        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  |                | Jungle    | 0xBE3400015045020D22EABAACBE3400        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  |                | Corn      | 0xF9C233705860211A28346830F9C233        | 1 / 8 chance[^0]    |  | -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |  | Bit Border[^4] | True      | The bits have a 1px solid black border  | Any pieces captured |  | (2 traits)     | False     | The bits don't have any border          | No pieces captuered |  | ============== | ========= | ======================================= | =================== |  | [^0]: Determined from `_seed`.                                                             |  | [^1]: Gap is omitted when dimension is 1 x 1.                                              |  | [^2]: The first 5 color generation traits are algorithms.
